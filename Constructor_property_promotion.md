## PHP 8: Constructor property promotion

This RFC adds syntactic sugar to create value objects or data transfer
objects. Instead of specifying class properties and a constructor for
them, PHP can now combine them into one.

Instead of doing this:
````php
    class Money 
    {
        public Currency $currency;
     
        public int $amount;
     
        public function __construct(
            Currency $currency,
            int $amount,
        ) {
            $this->currency = $currency;
            $this->amount = $amount;
        }
    }
````
You can now do this:
````php
    class Money 
    {
        public function __construct(
            public Currency $currency,
            public int $amount,
        ) {}
    }
````


This feature reduces a lot of boilerplate code when constructing simple
objects such as VOs and DTOs.

In short: property promotion allows you to combine class fields,
constructor definition and variable assignments all into one syntax, in
the construct parameter list.

So instead of doing this:
````php
    class CustomerDTO
    {
        public string $name;
    
        public string $email;
    
        public DateTimeImmutable $birth_date;
    
        public function __construct(
            string $name, 
            string $email, 
            DateTimeImmutable $birth_date
        ) {
            $this->name = $name;
            $this->email = $email;
            $this->birth_date = $birth_date;
        }
    }
````
You would write this:
````php
    class CustomerDTO
    {
        public function __construct(
            public string $name, 
            public string $email, 
            public DateTimeImmutable $birth_date,
        ) {}
    }
````
Let's look at how it works!



## How it works

The basic idea is simple: ditch all the class properties and the
variable assignments, and prefix the constructor parameters with
`public`, `protected` or `private`. PHP will take that new syntax, and
transform it to normal syntax under the hood, before actually executing
the code.

So it goes from this:
```php
    class MyDTO
    {
        public function __construct(
            public string $name = 'Brent',
        ) {}
    }
````
To this:
````php
    class MyDTO
    {
        public string $name;
    
        public function __construct(
            string $name = 'Brent'
        ) {
            $this->name = $name;
        }
    }
````
And only executes it afterwards.

Note by the way that the default value is not set on the class property,
but on the method argument in the constructor.

##  Promoted property properties

So let's look at what promoted properties can and can't do, there's
quite a lot of little intricacies worth mentioning!


###  Only in constructors

Promoted properties can only be used in constructors. That might seem
obvious but I thought it was worth mentioning this, just to be clear.

###  No duplicates allowed

You're not able to declare a class property and a promoted property with
the same name. That's also rather logical, since the promoted property
is simply transpiled to a class property at runtime.
````php
    class MyClass
    {
        public string $a;
    
        public function __construct(
            public string $a,
        ) {}
    }
````

###  Untyped properties are allowed

You're allowed to promote untyped properties, though I'd argue that
these days with [modern PHP](/blog/php-in-2020), you're better off
typing everything.
````php
    class MyDTO
    {
        public function __construct(
            public $untyped,
        ) {}
    }
````

###  Simple defaults

Promoted properties can have default values, but expressions like `new
…` are not allowed.
````php
    public function __construct(
        public string $name = 'Brent',
        public DateTimeImmutable $date = new DateTimeImmutable(), //not allowed
    ) {}
````

###  Combining promoted- and normal properties

Not all constructor properties should be promoted, you can mix and
match.
````php
    class MyClass
    {
        public string $b;
    
        public function __construct(
            public string $a,
            string $b,
        ) {
            $this->b = $b;
        }
    }
````
I'd say: be careful mixing the syntaxes, if it makes the code less
clear, consider using a normal constructor instead.



###  Access promoted properties from the constructor body

You're allowed to read the promoted properties in the constructor body.
This can be useful if you want to do extra validation checks. You can
use both the local variable and the instance variable, both work fine.
````php
    public function __construct(
        public int $a,
        public int $b,
    ) {
        assert($this->a >= 100);
    
        if ($b >= 0) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException('…');
        }
    }
````

###  Doc comments on promoted properties

You can add doc comments on promoted properties, and they are still
available via reflection.

```php
    class MyClass 
    {
        public function __construct(
            /** @var string */
            public $a,
        ) {}
    }

    $property = new ReflectionProperty(MyClass::class, 'a');
    
    $property->getDocComment(); // "/** @var string */"````
```


###  Attributes

Just like doc blocks, [attributes](/blog/attributes-in-php-8) are
allowed on promoted properties. When transpiled, they will be present
both on the constructor parameter, as well as the class property.
````php
    class MyClass
    {
        public function __construct(
            #[MyAttribute]
            public $a,  
        ) {}
    }
````
Will be transpiled to:
````php
    class MyClass 
    {
        #[MyAttribute]
        public $a;
     
        public function __construct(
            #[MyAttribute]
            $a,
        ) {
            $this->a = $a;
        }
    }
````

###  Not allowed in abstract constructors

I didn't even know abstract constructors were a thing, but here goes!
Promoted properties are not allowed in them.
````php
    abstract class A
    {
        abstract public function __construct(
            public string $a,
        ) {}
    }
````

###  Allowed in traits

On the other hand, they are allowed in traits. This makes sense, since
the transpiled syntax is also valid in traits.
````php
    trait MyTrait
    {
        public function __construct(
            public string $a,
        ) {}
    }
````

###  `var` is not supported

Old, I mean, experienced PHP developers might have used `var` in a
distant past to declare class variables. It's not allowed with
constructor promotion. Only `public`, `protected` and `private` are
valid keywords.
````php
    public function __construct(
        var string $a,
    ) {}
````

###  Variadic parameters cannot be promoted

Since you can't convert to a type that's `array of type`, it's not
possible to promote variadic parameters.
````php
    public function __construct(
        public string ...$a,
    ) {}
````
Still waiting for generics…


###  Reflection for `isPromoted`

Both `ReflectionProperty` and `ReflectionParameter` have a new
`isPromoted` method to check whether the class property or method
parameter is promoted.


###  Inheritance

Since PHP constructors don't need to follow the declaration of their
parent constructor, there's little to be said: inheritance is allowed.
If you need to pass properties from the child constructor to the parent
constructor though, you'll need to manually pass them:
````php
    class A
    {
        public function __construct(
            public $a,
        ) {}
    }
    
    class B extends A
    {
        public function __construct(
            $a,
            public $b,    
        ) {
            parent::__construct($a);
        }
    }
````
